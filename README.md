# Caesar Cipher Project

This project includes two implementations of the Caesar Cipher:

1. **Normal Caesar Cipher**: A basic version of the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.
2. **Optimized Caesar Cipher**: An optimized version that improves efficiency and handles the cipher in a more concise way.

## What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the input text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. 

### Features:
- Supports both encryption and decryption.
- Retains non-alphabetical characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) as they are.
- User can specify the shift amount.

## How to Use

1. Choose whether to "encode" (encrypt) or "decode" (decrypt) your message.
2. Enter the message.
3. Provide the shift amount (the number of positions to shift in the alphabet).

### Example

```bash
Type 'encode' to encrypt or 'decode' to decrypt: encode
Enter your message: hello
Enter the shift amount: 3
```

Output:
```
The encoded text is: khoor
```

### Requirements
This project does not require any external libraries. Just run it using Python.

## Folder Structure

- `normal_caesar.py`: Contains the normal version of the Caesar cipher.
- `optimized_caesar.py`: Contains the optimized version.
